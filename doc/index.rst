==========

TASKontrol is a framework for developing behavioral experiments.

It consists of modules written in Python and PySide (Qt for Python) that help design behavioral paradigms and provide a graphical user interface to control the experiments.

**This documentation is a work in progress. Many modules are still missing.**
