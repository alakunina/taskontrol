TASKontrol
==========

TASKontrol is a framework for developing behavioral experiments.

It consists of modules written in Python and PySide (Qt for Python) that help design behavioral paradigms and provide a graphical user interface to control the experiments. It is most commonly used with an Arduino interface to detect external events and trigger stimuli.

TASKontrol was originally developed by Santiago Jaramillo and it is maintained by the `Jaramillo Lab`_ at the University of Oregon.
