* Bugs and fixes:
*** TODO I have been using =smIDstr.split()[0]= to extract values,
    but maybe this will change if I split things in DoQueryCmd()
*** DONE I seem to be sending extra strings after GetEvents()
    The server says: "Got:  " and then "Connection to host ended..."
    SOLUTION: I just had to restart the FSM server to avoid this.
*** TODO Check if realines can be done by reading up to a line-break


* Questions:
*** What is the state matrix column called CONT_OUT in SetStateMatrix?
*** What is the state matrix column called TRIG_OUT in SetStateMatrix?
*** What does BypassDout() do?
    The comment says that it sets outputs to be whatever the state
    machine would indicate, bitwise or `d with "d."


* Python style
*** TODO Do not compare with == (singleton), use 'is'
*** DONE Use .join() instead of +=
*** TODO Be explicit about which exception is catched
*** DONE endswith() instead of slicing string
*** DONE Use isinstance(obj, int) instead of comparing types
*** TODO Don't compare boolean values to True or False using ==
*** TODO Use code-testing: :CODE_TESTING:

* Notes on developing in python:
*** Ipython:
***** Debugger:
******* Running 'run -d script' did not work:
	"AttributeError: Pdb instance has no attribute 'curframe'"
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ipython/+bug/381069
	But running "ipython -pdb" worked.
******* Trying to use pydb failed because it installed only for python2.4
******* SOLUTION: running 'ipython -pdb' worked fine.
***** TAB-autocompletion:
      It adds a blank space after the completion, very annoying.
      Try for example: cd /hom<TAB>

***** Profiler has to be installed separately because of its license:
      The Debian package is called 'python-profiler'.
      In any case, it didn't really work the way I wanted. Gotta try again.

* Misc:
*** I can't run the emulator on Ubuntu 9.10 because of a bug (in glibc?) about threads.
    It run fine on Ubuntu 9.04. I think the bug is related to:
