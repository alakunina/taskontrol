 TASKontrol installation and setup
___________________________________


===== Installation on a Debian/Ubuntu system =====

* Before starting you may need to update the list of packages:
  sudo apt-get update

* Install dependencies:
  sudo apt-get install git-core ipython python-qt4 python-numpy python-matplotlib

* Create and go to the directory where you want the code:
  mkdir ~/src
  cd ~/src/

* Clone source code from repository:
  git clone git://github.com/sjara/taskontrol.git

* Add directory to python path:
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/src


Notes:

* You also need pytables, but the package from the repository seems to have a bug. Install from .egg.

* If application fonts look bad (no anti-aliasing) on Gnome, you can change them to ‘DejaVuSansBook’ in System>Preferences>Appearance>Fonts>ApplicationFont

* Numpy 1.2.1 produces a segmentation fault when using matplotlib. Make sure you have a newer version.
