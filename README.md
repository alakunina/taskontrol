#  TASKontrol

TASKontrol is a framework for developing behavioral experiments.

It consists of modules written in Python and PySide (Qt for Python) for designing behavioral paradigms and providing a graphical user interface to control the experiments. TASKontrol does not control hardware directly. Instead, it provides a client to communicate with a finite state machine running on hardware connected to external signals. The default implementation of the state machine server runs on the Arduino platform.

TASKontrol was developed by Santiago Jaramillo and it is maintained by the [Jaramillo Lab](http://jaralab.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon.
