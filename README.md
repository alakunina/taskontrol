#  TASKontrol

TASKontrol is a framework for developing behavioral experiments.

It consists of modules written in Python and PySide (Qt for Python) for designing behavioral paradigms and providing a graphical user interface to control the experiments. It also includes software that runs in an [Arduino Due](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue) to provide an interface for detecting external events and triggering stimuli.

TASKontrol was developed by Santiago Jaramillo and it is maintained by the [Jaramillo Lab](http://jaralab.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon.
